# RQ Maintainability Handoff

## Current checkpoint: F2 Cairo-day reconciliation (2026-10-17; PR pending)

The focused branch `fix/f2-cairo-day-reconciliation` implements the next JARVIS task. `server/projections.ts` now owns the shared `getCairoDateKey` helper, which safely handles ISO strings, numbers, `Date` values, Firestore-like `toDate()` values, and malformed timestamps. Daily projection and `server/domain/garageReconciliation.ts` use the same Cairo-date predicate, so off-day and invalid events cannot affect today’s counts or revenue. `totalRecordedEvents` intentionally remains the raw input-array length for diagnostic visibility.

Regression coverage includes previous-day, next-day, Cairo boundary, missing, invalid, and non-date timestamps plus projection/reconciliation parity. Focused coverage passed (63 tests across reconciliation, projection, parity, and Worker garage-route tests). Full `npm run ci:check` passed with 132 test files / 871 tests, production build and artifact verification passed, `npm run maintainability:check` passed, and `git diff --check` passed. No Firestore data, rules, configuration, or deployment was changed.

The branch is ready to commit/push and open as a PR. After F2 merges, the single next JARVIS task is F3: remove or isolate the obsolete RQ duration/capacity/unlimited classifier without affecting garage-owned date-based monthly subscriptions.

## Previous checkpoint: legacy garage billing retirement (merged PR #114)

The owner confirmed that current garages/data are test-only and approved retiring the old time-based garage plan and EGP-wallet model without preserving active compatibility behavior. PR #114 makes new garages prepaid-credit-only with `{ paid: 0, referral: 0, trial: 0 }`, removes the garage package purchase UI, makes vehicle check-in ignore legacy expiry/daily-capacity/fair-use billing gates, and returns `LEGACY_BILLING_MODEL_RETIRED` (HTTP 410) from the old recharge, wallet top-up, self-subscribe, and referral-day endpoints. Monthly subscriptions sold by garages to their own customers remain separate and are not removed. Historical records are not deleted or rewritten. PR gates, post-merge Production Gate, and guarded Worker deployment/health smoke passed. Local validation passed at 132 test files / 870 tests, TypeScript, production build, maintainability, and diff checks.
